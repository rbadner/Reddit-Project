# Reddit-Project

Summary of project - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6Ovjxtn5sSGOk-UpK1Ly-eohcpQEZwVx7lAcc7siXU

The goal of this project was to improve FiveThirtyEight's Reddit engagement by webscraping Reddit pages and determining best practices for using Reddit. After conducting analysis on a selection of Reddit posts and their levels of engagement, I found that posting within popular subreddits is more important than the length (or content) of the post, on the condition that the post itself is at least somewhat related to a popular subreddit. Due to the nature of Reddit, followers will only see posts within subreddit pages they follow, so posting within popular pages will drive engagement more than posting at a particular time, or with a specific word count.
